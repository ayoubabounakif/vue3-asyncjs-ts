    * Async JS
- Governs how we perform tasks which take some time to complete
(e.g Getting data from a database)

    * Synchronous JS
- JS Can run ONE Statement at a time
console.log('Line One')
console.log('Line Two')
console.log('Line Three')

    * HTTP Requests
- Make HTTP requests to get data from another server
- We make these requests to API endpoints

    * API Endpoints
- Example API endpoint:
http://www.musicapi.com/artist/moby
